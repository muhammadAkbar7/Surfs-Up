## Sprints

Week 1: Finished building the app icon and launch screen. Challeges was getting the correct size for the launch screen, solved this by experimenting with different resolutions.

Week 2: Finished building the welcome screen. Challenges was making the image in a good resolution and also making the buttons white (for some reason they show differently on my phone (iPhone 14 pro) might be because lower target deployment)).
